Premium Question:
Description
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

our idea:
    # input = ["Hi", "this","is","an","example"]
    # encoded: 2#Hi4#this2#is2#an7#example
    # output = ["Hi", "this","is","an","example"]
to write length of each word before word followed by a symbol for ease of recognition.
 Note: we cannot simply store the length of these words outside because the question says stateless. ( we cannot store)
Example1

Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Explanation:
One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

Example2

Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
Explanation:
One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"
