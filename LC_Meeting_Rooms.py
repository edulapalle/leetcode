Description
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei),
determine if a person could attend all meetings.


(0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8

Example

Example1

Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: false
Explanation:
(0,30), (5,10) and (0,30),(15,20) will conflict

Example2

Input: intervals = [(5,8),(9,15)]
Output: true
Explanation:
Two times will not conflict
