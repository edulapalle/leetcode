"""
5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Medium

Given a string s, return the longest
palindromic

substring
 in s.



Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.
